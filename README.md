A collection of Data Science helper functions.

ABOUT
=====

The most useful object in Lambdata are the methods of the Data_cleaning class.
There you will find a simple method for getting the shape of a DataFrame, a simple 
method forgetting the column names, a simple method for getting a list of all null 
values and a method I created that will allow you to see the rows of a dataframe 
where a condition within a column is passed.
